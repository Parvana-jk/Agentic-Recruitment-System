Ensure a fair workload distribution among interviewers.
", agent="Interview Scheduler", status="completed", output="## Interview Schedule with Fair Workload Distribution
To achieve a fair workload distribution among interviewers, we need to analyze the available time slots for each interviewer and assign the best possible interview time for each candidate. 

### Step 1: Identify Available Time Slots for Each Interviewer
Based on the provided data, we can identify the available time slots for each interviewer. We will assume that each interviewer has a standard 8-hour workday (9:00-17:00) and is available for interviews during this time.

### Step 2: Assign Best Possible Interview Time for Each Candidate
We will assign a 1-hour time slot for each candidate interview. To ensure a fair workload distribution, we will try to distribute the interviews evenly among the interviewers.

### Step 3: Create the Interview Schedule
Here is the finalized schedule with interview slots for each candidate:

| Candidate Name | Candidate Email | Interviewer Name | Interview Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dorothy Thomas | dora@outlook.com | John Doe | 2025-04-01, 10:00-11:00 |
| peter kavinsky | petah@rmail.com | John Doe | 2025-04-02, 14:00-15:00 |
| Rishon LeZion | rishon@gmail.com | Jane Smith | 2025-04-03, 09:00-10:00 |
| Shawn cane | shawne@gmail.com | Jane Smith | 2025-04-01, 13:00-14:00 |
| Maggi Biever | mags@hotmail.com | Bob Johnson | 2025-04-02, 10:00-11:00 |

Note: The interview times are assigned based on the available time slots for each interviewer and the need to distribute the workload fairly. The actual interview times may vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the interview process.

### Workload Distribution
The workload distribution among the interviewers is as follows:

* John Doe: 2 interviews (Dorothy Thomas and peter kavinsky)
* Jane Smith: 2 interviews (Rishon LeZion and Shawn cane)
* Bob Johnson: 1 interview (Maggi Biever)

This distribution ensures that the workload is fairly balanced among the interviewers, with no interviewer having a significantly higher or lower workload than the others."

", agent="Interview Scheduler", status="completed", output="To plan the interview slots by balancing interviewer availability, we first need to analyze the available time slots for each interviewer, then assign the best possible interview time for each candidate, and ensure a fair workload distribution among interviewers.

Given the context, we have the following interviewer-candidate matches:
- Miranda Maddison (miranda@gmail.com) with John Doe
- Rishon LeZion (rishon@gmail.com) with Jane Smith
- Maggi Biever (mags@hotmail.com) with John Doe

And the provided slots are:
- 2025-04-01 10:00-12:00 for miranda@gmail.com with John Doe
- 2025-04-01 13:00-15:00 for rishon@gmail.com with Jane Smith
- 2025-04-02 14:00-16:00 for mags@hotmail.com with John Doe

However, each candidate interview is set for 1 hour. Therefore, we need to adjust the given slots to accommodate 1-hour interviews.

### Adjusted Interview Schedule:

1. **Miranda Maddison (miranda@gmail.com) - John Doe**
   - Original Slot: 2025-04-01 10:00-12:00
   - Adjusted Slot: 2025-04-01 10:00-11:00 (1 hour)
   
2. **Rishon LeZion (rishon@gmail.com) - Jane Smith**
   - Original Slot: 2025-04-01 13:00-15:00
   - Adjusted Slot: 2025-04-01 13:00-14:00 (1 hour)
   
3. **Maggi Biever (mags@hotmail.com) - John Doe**
   - Original Slot: 2025-04-02 14:00-16:00
   - Adjusted Slot: 2025-04-02 14:00-15:00 (1 hour)

### Finalized Schedule:

| Candidate Name | Candidate Email | Interviewer Name | Interview Date and Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Miranda Maddison | miranda@gmail.com | John Doe | 2025-04-01 10:00-11:00 |
| Rishon LeZion | rishon@gmail.com | Jane Smith | 2025-04-01 13:00-14:00 |
| Maggi Biever | mags@hotmail.com | John Doe | 2025-04-02 14:00-15:00 |

This schedule ensures that each candidate has a 1-hour interview slot and that the workload is fairly distributed among the interviewers. John Doe has two interviews, but they are on different days, allowing for a balanced workload. Jane Smith has one interview, and her availability for additional interviews, if needed, can be further evaluated based on her overall schedule."

The duration for Backend JAVA developer is not explicitly mentioned, so it's assumed to be `1` year (as the latest project started in 2020). Similarly, the duration for Full stack JAVA developer is not explicitly mentioned, but since it was between 2017-2019, it can be considered as `2` years.\n\nNote that I didn't consider \"Software R-Style language developer\" role because it's a different field of work (R-Style Language) and not related to Java. \n\nAlso note that the candidate is currently working in Backend JAVA developer role, but for calculation purposes, we consider only past roles when extracting duration."]"
